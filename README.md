# MnRI-Makerspace-Resources

This repository contains information, instructions, and resources for using the equipment in the University of Minnesota Robotics Institute's Makerspace. The MnRI Makerspace is created primarily to provide a space where Master's in Robotics students can apply their learning and create physical prototypes of robotic systems for their class projects, Capstone projects and Theses. 

The repo contains the following:
- A layout of the the makerspace,
- Configuration files for 3D printers, 
- Instructions for how to safely use each piece of reservable equipment,
- Instructions for how to reserve a piece of equipment.

___
# Makerspace Layout

The Makerspace is composed of two main spaces:
- A prototyping space, with work benches etc.,
- A fabrication space, with a variety of tools for additive and subtractive manufacturing.

## Prototyping Space

This space contains tables for mechanical prototyping, shelves which store equipment and supplies, benches for electrical engineering tasks such as soldering and wire harness creation. 

## Fabrication Space

This space contains the safety-critical equipment that requires training to use.
